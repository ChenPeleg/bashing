restarting did not solve the issue


Tried to do this

```Use containerd for pulling and storing images Give feedback
Use this if you need support for multi-platform images, image lazy-loading, or Wasm.
Only images and containers in the active image store are visible. All your other containers and images still exist. To see them again, turn off this feature.
```

Running as admin didnot work
